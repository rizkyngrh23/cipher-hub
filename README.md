## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**: A basic encryption technique where each letter is shifted by a fixed number.
- **Symbol Cipher**: Encodes letters using predefined symbols.
- **Reverse Cipher**: A simple cipher that reverses the order of characters in a message.
- **Binary Code**: Converts characters to their binary representation.
- **Tap Code**: A method of encoding letters based on a Polybius square.
- **Morse Code**: Translates text to Morse code, using dots and dashes for each letter.
- **Super Cipher**: A combination of all available ciphers for enhanced encryption.
